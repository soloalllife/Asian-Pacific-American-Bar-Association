    Scholarships to law students throughout the San Francisco bay area. The purpose of our scholarship is to recognize law students who have demonstrated leadership and service to the Asian Pacific American community, overcame personal hardships or challenges and shown excellence and achievement in law school. Many of our past recipients have interned during the summer at organizations that focus their legal services specifically towards the Asian Pacific American community. The Committee is also responsible for promoting the Scholarship to law schools in the bay area, as well as developing relationships between APBA and Scholarship recipients.
