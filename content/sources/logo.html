          This logo was designed using words that strongly reflect APABA-SV as an organization. Keywords such as community, network, justice, equality, empower and Asian American were used. In addition, the vision of APABA-SV is also about being interconnected, driven, focused, leadership, strong, bold, infinite and continuous. Combining all these elements, the new APABA-SV logo was created.

          The logo is made up to the letters APABA and it is arranged in a circle because the organization is continuous and connected. The corners of the letters all point inwards to represent direction, goal driven, focus and bringing people together - community. The boldness of the letters represent strength and empowerment. The logo is also equally balanced to show justice, equality and fairness.

          Kristen is currently studying graphic design at Academy of Art in San Francisco. Kristen holds a Bachelor and a Masters in Chemical Engineering. Kristen wants to use her graphics design skills to make a positive contribution to this world. Images are such powerful tools and combined with the right type and choice of words can make an impact or bring awareness to issues that may otherwise be ignored - "out of sight, out of mind". Kristen strives for substance and strives to communicate by creating emotional and intelligent design. Kristen feels very strongly about social justice, food ethics, the environment, women and children, improving conditions in third world countries and life experiences/stories of survival.
