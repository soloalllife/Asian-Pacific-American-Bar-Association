    We would like to invite you to join, and participate, in the Asian Pacific Bar Association of Silicon Valley ("APBA"). Formed over twenty years ago, APBA is an excellent forum for Asian American attorneys in Silicon Valley to network, develop professional skills, participate in community service, take positions on issues affecting Asian Americans, and empower Asian Americans in the Valley. Asian American attorneys in Silicon Valley play a critical role in enriching our legal and civic communities by practicing in every legal field - practicing in firms of all sizes, large and small corporations, academia, government, courts, legislature, and in public interest.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to fulfill its mission to foster professional development, advocacy and community involvement for Silicon Valley's Asian Pacific American legal community, and to promote justice and equality for all, APBA is forging coalitions with other minority bars and communities, including the Minority Bar Coalition, Vietnamese American Bar Association of Northern California, Southeast Asian Bar, Asian American Bar Association of the Greater Bay Area, the South Asian Bar Association, Santa Clara County Bar Association, various State Bar Committees, Asian Law Alliance and other local community organizations.

    Check us out! Some of our upcoming activities include friendly and informative social mixers, the Annual Banquet, monthly meetings and luncheons, and other events featuring prominent guest speakers. We also mentor law students, offer MCLE seminars, and perform community services.
